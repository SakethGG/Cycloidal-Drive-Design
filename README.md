#Cycloidal Drive Design

This repository contains CAD designs for a 20:1 reduction Cycloidal Drive. It includes:
Compact High-Performance Version (optimized for efficiency and durability)
Standard Version (functional but larger in size)

Upcoming Feature: Cycloid Gear Graphic Calculator
I will be adding a Python script to help in the design process of cycloidal drives. This tool will allow users to: Visualize cycloidal gear profiles interactively Adjust parameters dynamically Export designs to DXF for further use
This will be a port of an existing script with added features for better graphical display and ease of use. Stay tuned! 

Upcoming Updates:
I will be actively contributing to this repository to develop an industry-standard cycloidal drive with: Very low backlash for high precision
Optimised design for maximum efficiency Complete calculations and analysis Experimental data and validation
Stay tuned for detailed updates, including new CAD models, performance simulations, and real-world test results! Contributions and discussions are welcome. Feel free to collaborate and help improve the design.
