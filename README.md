# Cycloidal Drive Design

This repository contains CAD designs for a **20:1 reduction Cycloidal Drive**. It includes:

- **Compact High-Performance Version** (optimised for efficiency and durability)
- **Standard Version** (functional but larger in size)

## Upcoming Feature: Cycloid Gear Graphic Calculator
A **Python script** will be added to assist in designing cycloidal drives. This tool will allow users to:

**Visualise** cycloidal gear profiles interactively  
**Adjust** parameters dynamically  
**Export** designs to **DXF** for further use  

This will be a **port of an existing script** with added features for **better graphical display** and **ease of use**. **Stay tuned!**

## üîß Upcoming Updates
I will be actively contributing to this repository to develop an **industry-standard cycloidal drive** with:

- **Very low backlash** for high precision
- **Optimised design** for maximum efficiency
- **Complete calculations and analysis**
- **Experimental data and validation**

Stay tuned for **detailed updates**, including:
- **New CAD models**
- **Performance simulations**
- **Real-world test results**

### ü§ù Contributions
Contributions and discussions are **welcome**! Feel free to **collaborate** and help improve the design.
