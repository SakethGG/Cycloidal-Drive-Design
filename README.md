#Cycloidal Drive Design

This repository contains CAD designs for a 20:1 reduction Cycloidal Drive. It includes:
Compact High-Performance Version (optimized for efficiency and durability)
Standard Version (functional but larger in size)

Upcoming Feature: Cycloid Gear Graphic Calculator
I will be adding a Python script to help in the design process of cycloidal drives. This tool will allow users to: Visualize cycloidal gear profiles interactively Adjust parameters dynamically Export designs to DXF for further use
This will be a port of an existing script with added features for better graphical display and ease of use. Stay tuned!
